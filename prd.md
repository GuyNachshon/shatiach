# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Project Overview

This document outlines the Product Requirements for building a backend API for transcription, semantic querying, and agent-based interactions utilizing Local Language Models (LLM), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and reasoning-based Agents.

## Goals & Objectives

* Enable users to upload audio files and receive accurate transcriptions.
* Provide conversational interactions (chat) and summaries based on transcribed audio.
* Enable users to query an internal knowledge base stored as vectorized data in PDFs and text documents using Agentic RAG.

## Key Features

### 1. Transcription Service

* **Audio File Upload**: Multiple simultaneous uploads.
* **Language**: Hebrew.
* **Model Preference**: Local model for accuracy (e.g., Whisper-large).
* **Output**: Accurate transcriptions stored and retrievable via API.

### 2. Chat & Summarization on Transcribed Content

* Conversational interface via chat.
* Ability to summarize transcripts.
* Maintain session context/history for coherent interactions.

### 3. Vector Database & Agentic RAG Querying

* **Data Sources**: PDFs, Word documents, text files.
* **Vector DB**: ChromaDB.
* **Agent Framework**: Agno for intelligent reasoning and grounding.
* **Interaction**: Users can query knowledge-base conversationally.
* **Grounding**: Display sources for responses, enabling transparency.

### 4. File Search and Retrieval

* Search based on semantic similarity.
* Support retrieval of PDFs, Word, and text documents.
* Users can download matched files directly via the API.

## API Specification

### Core Endpoints:

* **Transcription**:

  * `POST /api/v1/transcribe` (Initiate transcription task)
  * `GET /api/v1/transcription/{transcription_id}` (Retrieve transcription)

* **Chat with Transcript**:

  * `POST /api/v1/chat` (Interact with transcripts)

* **Vector DB Queries (Agentic RAG)**:

  * `POST /api/v1/query` (Query internal knowledge base)

* **File Search & Download**:

  * `GET /api/v1/files/search?query={search_query}`
  * `GET /api/v1/files/{file_id}/download`

## Technical Stack

### Backend:

* **API Framework**: FastAPI (Python)
* **Transcription Model**: Whisper-large (local)
* **Agentic Reasoning**: Agno Framework
* **LLM**: Local deployment (e.g., Mistral, LLaMA fine-tuned for Hebrew)
* **Vector Database**: ChromaDB
* **Storage**: Local storage volumes, Docker-managed
* **Search**: ChromaDB semantic search (embedding-based)
* **Deployment**: Dockerized microservices, self-hosted

### Infrastructure:

* Docker containers orchestrated via Docker Compose
* GPU support for local models (NVIDIA CUDA recommended)

## Performance and Scalability

* **Initial Scope**: Designed for tens of concurrent users
* **Scaling**: Services containerized to support horizontal scaling if needed

## Security & Compliance

* No specific regulatory compliance required initially.
* Basic API security practices (JWT tokens, input validation)
* Data encrypted at rest (optional) and secured in transit (HTTPS)

## MVP Scope

* High-priority: Transcription, LLM-based interaction (Chat, Summary), and Agentic RAG
* Lower priority (post-MVP): Multiple simultaneous uploads, advanced search, and additional file formats

## Future Enhancements

* Real-time audio transcription
* Enhanced file search (Elasticsearch integration)
* Additional languages support
* Advanced analytics and monitoring dashboard
